# Ciphercorn

This is a very simple Swift app that allows you to send an iMessage or text encoded using a static cipher.

I wrote this for my daughter who was interested in sending an encoded message and then decoding that message using a cipher map that she had written down.

## Map

The following is the mapping of letters for the cipher.
